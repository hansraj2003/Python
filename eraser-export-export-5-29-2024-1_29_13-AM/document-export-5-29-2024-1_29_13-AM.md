# Immutables and Mutables

Python has two types of data types:- 1) Immutable 2) Mutables

> String being the immutable data type, we observe in terminal that value overwrites.

> But Python has different working. Python doesn't store the name of variables infact it stores the value the variable contain so when change the value or overwrite the value, new memory instance is created and now username points towards new memory location. And python garbage collector comes and picks up the value that are not being used in memory.

> There are two examples A and B shown in canvas to understand it properly. Thick Coloured lines shows final value that variable points to whereas thin white lines shows previous values that variable was referring too.

### You cannot make any changes into value that immutable data type hold Like in "Hansraj", we cannot change the value to "HAnsraj". We have to allot new memory to hold the value.
